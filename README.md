# PasswordManager
 A naive aproach to cryptography and hash encryption to make a password manager and generator.

This is a project that I started one night when i decided to stop using the same unsafe and predictable password for all my accounts. 
I did a little research in how password managers work and how passwords should be stored, and I came across some interesting points of 
view and videos wich i will refer in the resurces section.

There is a lot of work to do and i would like to make a better UI for the manager, I consider myself as an Image engineer so this is not
my field by any means so i expect that this way of doing cryptography and security is not a great one. Feel free to comment with whatever
you think could be changed im open to learn from people who really understand this.

I have some questions that i will try to find the answers, like why the start of the encrypted passwors is always the same, i think it has 
something to do with the masterPassword. Or the best way to avoid sql injections (Im a noob in SQL also).

thank you for passing by,
